Simple multi-module project in which tests are seperated from the main project.
===============================================================================

* Note that currently that the test project adds `src/main/resources/EMPTY` so
  creation of `target/classes` is enforced.
* Additionally `app/src/main/java` is added as source folders.
* This results in another compilation of the sources in the test project.
